    <strong>THEOREM 1:</strong> Supposed f and g be two real functions continuous at a real no. c.Then<br/>
    (1)f+g is continuous at x=c.<br/>
    (2)f-g is continuous at x=c.<br/>
    (3)f.g is continuous at x=c.<br/>
    (4)f/g is continuous at x=c, (provided g(c) not equal to 0)<br/> 
    <p>
    <strong>Proof:</strong> We are investigating continuity of $(f+g)$ at $x=c$.Clearly it is defined at $x=c$.We have

\begin{eqnarray*}
   \lim_{x \rightarrow c}(f+g)(x) & = & \lim_{x \rightarrow c}[f(x)+(x)] \\
   & = & \lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) + \lim_{x \rightarrow c}g(x) \\
   & = & f(c) + g(c) \\
   & = & (f+g)(c)
\end{eqnarray*}
    <p>
  <center>  Hence, f+g is continuous at x=c</center><br/>
   <center> Proofs for the remaining parts are similar </center>	


   <p>
   	<strong>THEOREM 2:</strong>Supposed f and g are real valued functions such that fog is defined at c.If g is continuous at c and if f is continuous at g(c),then (fog) is continuous at c.
