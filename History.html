	<center><p><strong>ON THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUITY IN HISTORY</strong></p></center><br/>

		Continuity, in mathematics, rigorous formulation of the intuitive concept of a function that varies with no abrupt breaks or jumps. A function is a relationship in which every value of an independent variable—say x—is associated with a value of a dependent variable—say y. Continuity of a function is sometimes expressed by saying that if the x-values are close together, then the y-values of the function will also be close. But if the question “How close?” is asked, difficulties arise.

		For close x-values, the distance between the y-values can be large even if the function has no sudden jumps. For example, if y = 1,000x, then two values of x that differ by 0.01 will have corresponding y-values differing by 10. On the other hand, for any point x, points can be selected close enough to it so that the y-values of this function will be as close as desired, simply by choosing the x-values to be closer than 0.001 times the desired closeness of the y-values. Thus, continuity is defined precisely by saying that a function f(x) is continuous at a point x0 of its domain if and only if, for any degree of closeness ε desired for the y-values, there is a distance δ for the x-values (in the above example equal to 0.001ε) such that for any x of the domain within the distance δ from x0, f(x) will be within the distance ε from f(x0). In contrast, the function that equals 0 for x less than or equal to 1 and that equals 2 for x larger than 1 is not continuous at the point x = 1, because the difference between the value of the function at 1 and at any point ever so slightly greater than 1 is never less than 2.
