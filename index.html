<p> We had learnt to differentiate different functions like polynomial function and trigometric functions.In this article, we introduced the very important concept of continuity,differentiability and relation between them.We will also learn differeniation of inverse trigonometric functions.Further we introduce a new class of funtions called exponential and logarithmic functions.These functions lead to powerful techniques of differentiation.In the process we will learn some fundametal theorems in this area. </p>
